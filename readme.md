# Word Frequency Counter API (Go)

A simple HTTP API written in Go that counts how many times each word appears in a given input text.  
The API is **case-insensitive**, ignores punctuation, and returns results sorted by:

1. **Highest frequency first**
2. **Alphabetically for ties**

---

## Features
- Accepts text input via query parameter (`GET /count?text=...`)
- Removes punctuation (e.g., commas, periods, etc.)
- Converts text to lowercase before counting
- Returns results in JSON format
- Sorts by frequency (descending) and alphabetically (ascending) when counts match

---

## Example

**Request:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/count?text=Go+is+fun+and+go+is+easy"

**Response:**

[
  {"word": "go", "count": 2},
  {"word": "is", "count": 2},
  {"word": "and", "count": 1},
  {"word": "easy", "count": 1},
  {"word": "fun", "count": 1}
]

##Installation & Running ##
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/word-frequency-counter.git
cd word-frequency-counter
2. Run the application:
go run main.go
3. The server will start on:
http://localhost:8080

**How It Works**
Extracts the text query parameter from the request.

Converts all characters to lowercase.

Removes punctuation using regex.

Splits text into words.

Counts each wordâ€™s frequency.

Sorts results:

First by frequency (high to low)

Then alphabetically (A-Z) if counts are the same.

Sends the result as a JSON array.
